# 💫 Seasons

We want this game to be living and evolving. As life has cycles & seasons, so we think a living game should also integrate this concept.

That is why we will be launching multiple seasons with avatarss & accessories from atwork created by multiple artists, highlighting the creative talent from across the Internet Computer artist community!

Each season will also have his own story and a purpose.

## Catch them all

Seasons also add an element of visual rarity, since all-new characters and accessories minted will only be for the artwork of the current season. Once a season is over, there will never be avatarss or accessories with that exact same artwork generated again.

_This gives an unique opportunity for early adopters to collect accessories and a status symbol in a few years._

### Multiple Avatarss across different seasons

We want to reward veteran players. In light of that, there will be a slight advantage given to players who collect an avatar during each season.

Starting with Season 1, Avatars will be mintable in 3 different tiers and having properties which effect the style score. When a player has avatars from multiple seasons in their wallet, their active avatar gets an additional bonus to its properties:

* 2 different seasons = 5% boost
* 3 different seasons = 10% boost
* 4 different seasons = 15% boost
* 5 different seasons = 20% boost
* 6 different seasons = 25% boost
* 7 different seasons = 30% boost
* 8 different seasons = 35% boost
* 9 different seasons = 40% boost
* 10+ different seasons = 45% boost (this is the max)

### **Season 0**

#### **Characters & accessories**

These first characters are made with love to be cherished by the early adopters who made this project possible. We’ve chosen a human-based design with we hope will appeal to a broad audience of enthusiasts.

Arun caught our attention because he is already known for creating fantastic custom Avatars for a handful of the earliest DFINITY team members and community admins. Out of all the art concepts we collected for review, his work best captured our vision for the Season 0 characters and reflected his excitement for this project. You can find more art by Arun on his Instagram ([@\_arunarts](https://www.instagram.com/\_arunarts/)).

**Purpose**

The Internet Computer is still an emergent technology. The community is also in its childhood: early contributors are taking on more responsibilities and bonds are being created.

The main purpose of this season is to create a strong base for the community and test the concept of the game. We know that we won't get everything perfect from the beginning, but we have chosen an experimental approach, as we believe this is where most of the lessons can be learned.

On a technical side the season 0 will also match with the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the game, and we will be adding more features along with each season.
