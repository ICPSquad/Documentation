# üèÜ Leaderboard

The gameplay is divided into monthly **contests**. The scores of all the participants are set to 0 during the first day and then the goal is to increase your rank on the leaderboard by increasing your total score until the end of the contest. After the contest is over rewards are sent out based on your rank.

Each contest has a **start date**, **end date** and a **reward pool.**

### **Scores**

Your rank is the leaderboard is determined by your **total score.**

Your total score is the sum of 2 different scores.

* **Style score**

This score is determined by the accessories you were wearing on your avatar during each day of the contest.

Your style score is calculated by the daily sum of all the stars of the accessories you are wearing.

_üë®‚Äçüè´ For instance if the contest lasts for 30 days and you are wearing 2 accessories during this whole period. The first one being the **Helicap** & the other one being the **Lab coat**._

![3 stars (Body)](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-06-08 aÃÄ 19.05.04.png>) ![2 stars (Hat)](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-06-08 aÃÄ 19.05.25.png>)

_If you are wearing your two accessories without interruption during the 30 days you will generate 30 x (3 + 2) = 150 points._

* **Engagement score**

This score is determined by the **missions** you have completed during this period and the number of actions you have taken across multiple dApps. This represents an approximation of how much **time** you have invested in the game.

![Total score = Style + Engagement](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-06-08 aÃÄ 18.57.40.png>)

Your **engagement score** is calculated by summing up two components.

1\) **Daily bonus** : every day based on your activity in the ecosystem you'll be granted a number of points. This score is updated automatically everyday.

Currently, to prevent any abuse the bonus of the day is capped to **0** or **1**.

0 means that you haven't had enough activity this day to get a bonus.

1 means that the game considers you as an **active** player and grant you a bonus for this day.

As the Internet Computer ecosystem and the game expands, this daily bonus will incorporate metrics from different dApps (Games, social media, DeFi...) and will be more granular.

As of today : the score is based on your trading activity : if you have a recorded transaction involving more than **1 ICP** (Sale or buy) you are considered an active player for this day.

2\) **Missions** : whenever you validate a mission. Your engagement score will be increased by the number of points granted by this mission.

‚ö†Ô∏è The leaderboard and scores can take up to 1 hour to update.&#x20;
