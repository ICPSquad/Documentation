# 📜 Missions

Missions are a very important aspect of gameplay to bring us closer to the long term engage-to-earn concept of our project.

A **mission** is an action that you need to take in an Internet Computer dapp. It can be as simple as making a trade or a swap on a DEX or it can go as far as solving a complex puzzle in a game. In the future, once a mission has been completed it might transform into an **action** which will give you ongoing points as you continue to engage. For example, the mission make be "make a DSVCR account" and then once complete it'll also give you points whenever you gain DSCVR points on their platform.

Some missions might only appear during **events**.

A mission when completed will give you points to improve your score, and in the future there will be mission which give immediate token and/or NFT rewards.&#x20;

In the future dSquad members will be even be able to create their own missions.

### **Where to find missions?**

A list of currently all available missions is displayed on our website.&#x20;

Each missions has a description explaining the steps that you need to take in order to complete it. Once you have completed the actions, you need to validate. If the system confirms that you have met all the criteria, your reward will be unlocked!

For the moment, you can only complete each mission once. You score only will be increased for the current contest, so pick your timing wisely when collecting points from completed missions!
