# 📜 Missions

Missions are a very important aspect of gameplay to bring us closer to the long term engage-to-earn concept of our project.

A **mission** is an action that you need to take in an Internet Computer dapp. It can be as simple as making a trade or a swap on a DEX or it can go as far as solving a complex puzzle in a game. In the future once a missions has been completed it might transform into an **action** which will give you rewards in terms of points every time you do it again to incentivise constant engagement.

Some missions might only appears during **events**.

A mission when completed will give you access to rewards.&#x20;

It will usually increase your **engagement score** but some missions can also give you access to special prizes in forms of tokens or NFTs. In the future squad members will be able to create their own missions.

### **Where to find missions ?**

A list of currently all available missions is displayed on our website.&#x20;

Each missions has a description, explaining the steps that you need to take in order to complete it. Once you have completed the actions, you need to validate. If the system considers that you have met all the criteria, your reward will be unlocked !
