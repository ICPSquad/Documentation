# üí∞ Economy Basics

### Goals

#### **Low barrier to entry**&#x20;

Speculation and valuable prizes are fun, but it's not fair when games are too expensive for new players to join in. To get the best of both worlds, we designed a dual NFT system.

Avatar NFTs give the wallet holder the ability to win rewards. Personalized Avatars can be minted at any time for a flat rate of 1 ICP, which keeps the entry price low for all new players so that the NFT game stays open and inclusive.

Accessory NFTs are speculative assets with a supply that stayed limited compared to the number of players, and they improve a players odds of winning rewards. The reward pool includes Material NFTs, which can be used to mint Accessories. There are inflationary and deflationary mechanics to make sure accessories stay rare and valuable.

_After all, what‚Äôs an NFT game without a bit of speculation and collection fun?_

#### **Fair rewards favoring strategic and active players**

Earlier adopters and contributors, heavy Internet computer users, and heavily invested users deserve some advantage in our game. However, insiders, bots, and whales should never be able to hog rewards and ruin the fun for everyone else. Our goal is to create a balanced and fair reward system, in in the long term we want it to focus as much as possible on rewarding activity which benefits everyone.

#### Long Term Market Stability <a href="#long-term-market-stability" id="long-term-market-stability"></a>

Most NFT projects are near-term pump and dump schemes with extremely volatile price swings. Our goal is to create a game with long-term market stability that‚Äôll grow to interact with as many Internet Computer apps as possible and act as a focal point for bringing the community together to support the entire ecosystem.

#### _Reward mechanisms_&#x20;

Rewards will be airdropped monthly based on player rank during the previous month.&#x20;

An easy way to think of this game is that it is basically like a massive ongoing raffle between everyone who uses the IC and owns a character.

The game needs to incentivise engagement and investment to make things worthwhile without giving bad actors the ability to ruin the fun.

To pull this off, we‚Äôll be using a lot of fancy math based on robust statistics, but in this guide, we‚Äôll aim to explain the basic approach in simple terms.

#### Lowest ranked player

To be eligible to win a reward in a monthly contest, players will need to own at least (1) Level 1 character and either wear an accessory or complete an action/mission during that month. The ‚Äú**Lowest Ranked Player**‚Äù would be the player that meets the bare minimum standard. They own a Level 1 Character with no accessories and perform only one action, so they are essentially given the worst odds of winning that contest.

We are going to cap style and engagement advantages against this hypothetical ‚Äú**Lowest Ranked Player**.‚Äù

#### Max advantage cap

The top player can have up to a 200x chance of winning a reward over the lowest-ranked player by maxing out both the style score cap and engagement score cap. While this may seem like a lot, it just means that no one can give themselves a higher chance of winning than the bottom 200 players on any given day.

We‚Äôll also be tweaking these thresholds over time with community feedback to find and maintain a balance that ensures fair yet engaging gameplay.&#x20;

Hopefully, these caps will mean that buying advantage is worth it but not enough to make things drastically unfair. Doing lots of activity is also worth it but not a guaranteed way to hog everything for yourself. We want a game full of surprises where anything can happen. Everyone is essentially playing the odds in a low-key environment with various amounts of speculation and risk that match their preference.

### **Accessories**

We are designing the economy to ensure that accessories will consistently stay rare & valuable.

For each accessory slot we are targeting a supply range based on a percentage of the player population.&#x20;

**Inflation :** is controlled by sending monthly rewards to players. Rewards are sent as materials but ultimately through recipes these materials will be burned to mint accessories.&#x20;

**Deflation :** is controlled by making accessories slowly wear out over a few months. Once worn out, the accessory is burned. The one exception being legendary accessories that never wear out.

This is the **maximum** proportion that we are targeting for accessories within each slot:&#x20;

**Eyes** | Up to 30-40% of avatar holders can fill this slot.

**Head** | Up to 20-30% of avatar holders can fill this slot.

**Face** | Up to 10-20% of avatar holders can fill this slot.

**Body** | Up to 10-20% of avatar holders can fill this slot.

**Misc** | Up to 2-5% of avatar holders can fill this slot.

Recipes are designed to fill these targets. We will regularly assess our economy to see how we are positioning compared to those initial objectives.

### Live Statistics&#x20;

On the Accessory mint page, players will be able to see live statistics on the supply, floor price, and last purchase price for each accessory so that they have all the information they need to make an educated decision. As time goes on we hope to add more public statistical resources to help players easily track our economy.
