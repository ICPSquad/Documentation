# üéÅ Airdrops & rewards

Rewards are sent out monthly after the end of each contest. The distribution is based on the ranks of each player, with a fair distribution curve and a bit of luck to make things funs. üçÄ

Right now the reward pool will primarily consist of materials.&#x20;

### **Materials**

Each material (except **branded materials)** has a targeted value of the supply of total materials associated with it. You can read this value directly on the card.

This value ranges from 48% of the supply for the most common material (Cloth) to 1% of the supply for the most rare material (Dfinity Stone).

Every month the total value of materials that are airdropped will be determined according to the burn rate of our economy. If more people are wearing out accessories, more rewards will be distributed. This will keep our economy balanced from excess inflation/deflation while continuously spreading out the supply to as many participants as possible.

### _Partner NFTs_

Being part of the biggest community hub on the Internet Computer, we are regularly partnering with other projects on the IC, most of them like giving away NFTs. **Top ranked players will get more chance to win these limited airdrops.**&#x20;

Here are some of the projects we collaborated with in the past; more is to come.
