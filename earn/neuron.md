# ðŸ§  dSquad Neuron

### **Concepts**

If you are not familiar with the **Network Nervous System**. Please read this[ article ](https://www.dfinitycommunity.com/the-beginners-guide-to-the-network-nervous-system-nns/)first.

### Goals

* Take our part in the decentralisation of the **NNS** and increase engagement with governance process.
* Help develop governance tools and framework for a better management and accountable leaderships.
* Increased benefits for accessory holders and assured baseline of rewards.
* Increased stability for the game economy.

The **dSquad Neuron** is locked with an 8-years delay and its stake is continually being increased through different in-game mechanisms.&#x20;

### Funding&#x20;

The dSquad Neuron will be funded trough different mechanisms.

* **Accessory minting fee** (currently set at 0.5 ICP). All accessories fees are directly sent to the Neuron.
* **Legendary accessories sale :** 10% of the sale of legendary accessories is directly sent to the Neuron.

### Our neuron

In the coming weeks as we prepare for the full launch of the the dSquad Neuron we'll be making it's meta-information (ID, followees, etc.) available.

### Rewards

On a regular basis (right now we are thinking weekly), the maturity from this Neuron will be spawned and distributed to all active players who have an accessory equipped on their character.

The share of ICP given to each player is determined by their ranking over that applicable time period, which, like with normal rewards, is determined by their character properties and amount of activity on the Internet Computer (with twice as much weight given to activity). Unlike with normal rewards, each player with an equip Avatar can expect to get something.&#x20;

_**Every player who has a character wearing an accessory gets a non-zero share of the dSquad Neuron maturity.**_

This system will ensure an ongoing foundation of ICP rewards for accessory users, increasing the utility and burn rate of accessories.

Since non-legendary accessories wear out over time, new accessories must be continually minted. Those minting fees will continue to grow the size of the ICP Squad Neuron.

This also means that over enough time, whether the number of active players remains the same or grows significantly, the value of ICP sent to accessory holders will continue to increase along with the size of the ICP Squad Neuron.

### Governance&#x20;

We plan to use the governance power of that neuron to vote on proposals and make the voice of our community heard.&#x20;

We also have big plans for turning our project into a DAO in the future, and this neuron is a first step in that direction.
