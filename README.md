# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to dSquad!

dSquad is a contributor-run community with aspirations to eventually convert into a DAO.

The purpose of our NFT project is to organically build a gamification & digital merchandising open platform that can be used by community projects to collaboratively promote the entire Internet Computer Ecosystem.

## Create&#x20;

Design your avatar, which you'll be able to use for completing missions and earning tokens and NFTs. You will be able to customise all physical attributes of your Avatar NFT during the minting process. ðŸ‘¦

## Collect&#x20;

Collect Material NFTs and then combine them to mint Accessory NFTs which your Avatar can wear! Wearing accessories helps you increase your odds of winning airdrops, gain perks, and... show off. ðŸ˜Ž

## Engage&#x20;

Get rewarded through monthly airdrops as you explore the ecosystem, complete missions and interact with applications. ðŸŽ²

## Connect&#x20;

Participate in events and contests with the community, and make your way to becoming a legend and earning special prizes. ðŸ«‚

## **Grow**&#x20;

Are you an ICP project looking for more user engagement? ðŸ“ˆ
