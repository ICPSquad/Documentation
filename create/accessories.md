# üëë Accessories

Accessories are valuable collectibles that can interact with your avatar and completely transform your appearance. They also give you special benefits and increase your chance of earning rewards.

### Equip your Avatar.

Each Avatar can be equipped with up to 5 accessories corresponding to the 5 following slots:

* **Hat** üé© : Hats, helmets, crown, cap, headband... Everything that is going on the head.
* **Face** üë¶ : Painting face, facial mask, gas mask, facial tattoos... Anything that can be put on your face (expect glasses).
* **Glasses** üëì : Lab glasses, monocle, sunglasses. To protect your eyes.
* **Body** üëî : Shirts, jackets, necklaces, ties, sweat, costumes and more.
* **Miscellaneous** üåà : This slot was created to leave room for any creative ideas we might have which wouldn't fit the other slots. This season it consists of 2 different Avatar backgrounds, but who knows what we'll add in the future!

### Properties

Each accessory is represented by a card. This card is stored as an NFT. If you are the owner of an accessory this is how it will be presented in your wallet.

![Accessories card](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-06-07 aÃÄ 19.19.10.png>)

On each card you can see the 4 importants properties of an accessory.

* **Rarity** : This score is an indication of how hard it will be to create this accessory. The more stars it has the more points this accessory will generate each day it's equip. During MVP this ratio is 1:1 (ex: A 1 star accessory will generate 1 point/day, a 5 star will generate 5 points/day, etc)
* **Slot** : This is an icon to indicate the slot this accessory will fill.
* **Wear (value)** : This is a number between 0 and 100 that indicates the wearability of an accessory. Every day an accessory is equipped on your avatar it generates points but also decreases it's wear value by one. Eventually when the wear value reaches 0 the accessory will be automatically burned.
* **Season** : At the top of the card you can see the season this accessory was part off. Once a season is over, the accessories of this season will never be mintable again; but you will still be able to use them. Because accessories that are used will eventually burn this means some accessories will become increasingly rare collectibles as time goes on, and some may even disappear completely if the supply reaches 0. **Imagine in 10 years meeting someone on the Internet Computer auctioning off the only 5-star accessory left from Season 0 which still has all it's original wear value (never been worn)!**

### **Materials**

To create accessories, you will need to collect materials. Materials are the raw ingredients of our economy and primary rewards for the monthly airdrops. These NFTs can also be traded on a [marketplace](https://entrepot.app/marketplace/icpsquad2).

Materials are also represented by cards, but they are different from accessories.

![The most common material.](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-06-07 aÃÄ 19.54.06.png>)

Each card contain the **supply value** of the corresponding material. This value represents the targeted proportion of this material's supply within our NFT economy.

For instance : **wood** has a supply value of 24%. If 10 000 materials where released, the number of wood released would be 2400.

_‚ö†Ô∏è This value is a target and that will be used as a reference for airdrops and rewards. This means it his highly likely that at any point in time the targeted value won't perfectly match the actual value in the real economy. Live supply values will be made available on our website to help players to make the best decisions based on their objectives._

### Recipes

Each accessory can only be created by following a specific recipe. A recipe corresponds to a list of materials. Here is an example for the _**Shinobi suit.**_

![A recipe](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-06-07 aÃÄ 20.02.12.png>) ![Shinobi suit](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-06-07 aÃÄ 20.06.29 (1).png>)

The recipe is directly related to the rarity of the accessories as well as the slot they belong to. As accessories increase in rarity the amount and rarity of the materials needed to mint them also increases.

### Style score

Each day your avatar will generate a **style score** based on every accessory that is **equipped** on it.

The style score generated daily by an equipped accessory is equal to its number of stars.

Assuming you have a 3-stars accessory equipped during a period of 10 days, you will generate in total during this period a style score of 3 x 10 = **30 points**.

Your style score is an essential metric for determining your rank in the **leaderboard** and the rewards that will be sent out to your character.

### Burning

Every day an accessory is equipped it's wear value is decreased by 1. When this value reaches 0 it will automatically get burned and removed from your character.

_‚ö†Ô∏è The action of equipping or removing an accessory also costs 1 point of wear value._

### **How to create accessories?**

A section on our website is dedicated to the creation of accessories. You will find all important information necessary to pick the perfect accessory directly within the mint page (supply, floor price, and last sold price).

![Create an accessory](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-06-08 aÃÄ 16.57.04.png>)

### _How to equip accessories?_

Another section is dedicated to the usage of accessories. Here you will be able to see all the accessories that you own and equip/unequip them.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-06-08 aÃÄ 17.01.13.png>)

When you hover over an accessory that is not already equipped, it will automatically show you a preview of how the accessory will look like on your avatar! If you wish to add it your avatar you just need to click and wait a few seconds for the change to apply. After a few seconds you will see a confirmation message and the changes will automatically be reflected if you take a look in your wallet.

### Benefits of Accessories

* Wearing then gives you Style Score points to increase your ranking in the leaderboard so you can win monthly airdrops! These airdrops primarily consist of materials, but at times partner NFTs and even ICP will be added to the prize pools.
* In the coming weeks we'll be activating the dSquad neuron, which will collect all Accessory Minting fees into an 8 year NNS neuron and distribute the neuron ICP rewards to all Avatars wearing Accessories. This means simply wearing an Accessory may help you win ICP rewards!
* In the near future we'll be releasing accessories branded by some of our integration partners, and some of these may even come with perks offered by the partner on their dapp.
* Since accessories are kept rare and can even wear out just like items in the real world, there's opportunity for long term collecting and price speculation just like with any other NFT collection.

### Legendary Accessories

These are a special type of Accessory with never burn and cannot be minted. They have unique artwork created individually by our artist and offer incredible benefits across the whole ecosystem. More details will be released in the weeks to come.
