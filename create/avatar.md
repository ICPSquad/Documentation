# Avatar

### Dual NFT-system&#x20;

This project has a unique **dual-NFT** approach with characters and accessories.&#x20;

Characters are composable and dynamic NFTs, meaning they can evolve, change their properties and wear accessories that will impact their visual appearance.&#x20;

Characters are avatars that you can fully customise with a different assortiments of visual properties. They are stored as NFTs using the Internet Computer blockchain.&#x20;

Minting your avatar is your ticket to join dSquad and get on the monthly leaderboards so that you can be eligible to win airdrops!

### Low barrier to entry&#x20;

This project aims to be inclusive and promote engagement on the Internet Computer, so it needs to stay accessible to anyone who want to support and join the squad. We understand that speculation is an inherent part of crypto-economies but this game will be designed so that everyone can play, regarding of their own economical means.&#x20;

Keeping the floor price of characters low, we are offering everyone the opportunity to get a unique avatar on the IC that they'll be able to use across multiple dApps.

The current price to mint a character is **1 ICP**.

You only need 1 Avatar NFT to be part of the game, there are no benefits to having multiple Avatar NFTs from the same season in your wallet. It's also important to know that while you can transfer Avatar NFTs, they are not tradeable on exchanges at this time. Avatars aren't meant for speculative flipping and rarity, that's what we designed Accessories for!

### **Step 1 : Head over to our official website.**

Just click on 'Create avatar' and you will be redirected to the minting page.

### **Step 2 : Customise your look.**

Hey, it's not like in the real life. Here you can create the look that fits you best!

Pick a category on the right and choose among the several different options offered to you. You can even choose the **color of your eyes**, if you wish to. We usually recommend sticking to the suggested color options to keep some harmony, but you're free to pick any color you want with the color picker.

If you're not feeling inspired, you can get some suggestions using the **green shuffle button.** &#x20;

Take your time, don't forget that your avatar will be used in several places to represent you, so pick wisely!

### **Step 3 : Pay the minting fee**

Once you ready, click and head over to the next step. This is where you'll need to login with your wallet.&#x20;

After being logged in, you'll be prompted to pay **1 ICP** to continue further.&#x20;

_Note : At this point If you already paid during the preorder but never had a chance to mint your avatar, you can skip the payment and click on the second button. If you have no idea what the preorder is than does not apply to you._&#x20;

Then you will need to authorize the payment using your wallet. Make sure your balance is enough to cover the transaction fee (at least 1.0001 ICP needs to be in your wallet).&#x20;

After confirmation the system will process your payment. This step only requires approximately 10 seconds.

### **Step 4 : Mint your Avatar**

After the payment has been processed you'll need to confirm one last time to send the mint request. ****&#x20;

As in the picture, you will likely see a warning message from your wallet. This is a common warning message we are trying to work with the wallet provider to get removed.

### **Step 5 : Receive your Avatar in your wallet.**

After waiting a few seconds, you will see your avatar appearing in your wallet under the "ICP Squad" section.&#x20;

The number that you will see corresponds to the minting number of your avatar.
